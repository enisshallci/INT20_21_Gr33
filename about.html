                Our commitment is to hire and train the best guides in the industry. We seek out career-minded guides with extensive personal and professional wilderness experience,
                 as well as hard skills and certifications. Perhaps most important though is that Wildland guides are knowledgeable, friendly, helpful and passionate.When possible,
                  we prefer to get our groups not only far away from roads and crowds, but even off hiking trails. This type of intimate wilderness travel is most conducive to small groups,
                  with often max of 5 or 6 guests, and at most 12.We provide gear; local transportation (with a few exceptions); meals; necessary permits; reservations and fees;
                   natural and cultural history interpretation and more!
